Tuple vs Array

1) Type Consistency
2) Type Safety
3) Mutability (do not allow change type in Tuple)
4) Use Cases

Note:  The difference between tuples and arrays in TypeScript is that tuples are more strict and precise than arrays. Tuples can store only a fixed number of elements and types at each index, 
while arrays can store any combination of types and the order is not important.
